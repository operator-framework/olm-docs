  <h2 class="of-heading of-heading--md">WHAT is operator lifecycle manager?</h2>
  <p> Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) helps users install, update, and manage the lifecycle of all Operators and their associated services running across their clusters. It is part of the Operator Framework, an open source toolkit designed to manage Kubernetes native applications (Operators) in an effective, automated, and scalable way.</p>

<p> OLM aids cluster administrators in installing, upgrading, and granting access to Operators running on their cluster.</p>

<p> For developers, a self-service experience allows provisioning and configuring instances of databases, monitoring, big data services etc without having to be subject matter experts, because the Operator has that knowledge baked into it.</p>
